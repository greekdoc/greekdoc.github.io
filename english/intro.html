			<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

		<div id="main">

				When you first studied Greek, especially Koine Greek, you were given a vocabulary list at the beginning of each lesson. By various means, you learned the meaning of each Greek word, then the lesson explained the necessary inflections. In this way, you could translate the sample sentences.
			</p><p>
				As you progressed, you learned that there are, in some instances, two Greek words which could be translated by the same English meaning. It was necessary to distinguish the nuances of these.
			</p><p>
				You probably learned that there are three words for "love." Actually there are several more. Nouns: ἀγάπη, ἀγάπησις, ἔρως, στοργή, and φιλία. Verbs: ἔραμαι, ἐράω, στέργω, and φιλέω. 
			</p><p>
				This website lists English words used in the New Testament, Old Testament Septuagint (LXX), Early Church Documents (i.e., Apostolic Fathers), and Apocrypha. Under each English word is a list of corresponding Greek words. Clicking on the Greek word will take you to a Greek lexicon which is included in this website. Hitting your "back" key will return you to the search word.
			</p><p>
				At the top of each page is a menu index to help you find the English word you want. Likewise when you are in the Greek lexicon, there is a menu at the top of each page. When you click on [INDEX] in the menu, you will be taken to a list both English and Greek first letters which will link you to the initial page from which you can select the word you want.
			</p><p>
				Most of the time, an English word which could be a noun or a verb will be found under one listing. For instance <b>kiss</b> will list both the verb (φιλέω) and the noun (φίλημα) Greek words. Verbs can be easily identified because they have one of three endings (-ω, -μι, -ομαι) while other parts of speech have other endings. The English verbs are in the infinitive form (without the initial "to"). Thus, if you wanted <b>ran</b> you need to select <b>run</b>.
			</p><p>
				There are many English words that have two or more meanings. For instance <b>pen</b> can mean a writing instrument (γραφεῖον) or an animal enclosure (σηκός). By clicking on one of the Greek words under <b>pen</b> you will see a more precise meaning when you are taken to the Greek Lexicon.
			</p><p>
				If you page through the English words, you will come across words you never realized were in Greek religious texts. For instance, you will see the word <b>giraffe</b> and wonder about it. The Greek word for giraffe is καμηλοπάρδαλις which is a combination of κάμηλος (camel) (because of its body shape) and πάρδαλις (leopard) (because of its spots). The word is found only once in Greek religious texts (Deut. 14:5 LXX) as one of the "clean" animals where the MS text has <b>zemer</b> which is probably a mountain sheep. Of course the LXX use of giraffe as one of the clean animals must have confused some Jews, although giraffes are not common in the Middle East.
			</p><p>
				The intention of this webpage is to help you to cross-reference words from English to Greek. But it is also a very comprehensive Greek lexicon.
