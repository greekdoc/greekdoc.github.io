<h2>Element names and symbols</h2>

When you sat in chemistry class, you no doubt puzzled over the abbreviation for some of the elements.
"H" for hydrogen seemed simple, and so did "O" for oxygen.
But why is "K" for potassium, "Na" for Sodium, and "Fe" for Iron?

<!-- 52-5 -->
<dl>
<dt>1 Hydrogen H</dt>
	<dd>discovered by Nicolas Lémery who was sure it was one of the components of water, thus the link to the Greek word ὕδωρ meaning "water"</dd>

	<dd>comes from ἥλιος the Greek sun god because it was first found in the solar atmosphere</dd>

<dt>8 Oxygen O</dt>

	<dd>was a new element named after the Greek word νέος for "new" when Sir William Ramsay discovered it </dd>
<dt>11 Sodium Na</dt>
