Suppose you were the first person ever to see a giraffe and it was your responsibility to name it.
Upon first inspection, you couldn't help noticing its long neck and then its spotted sides.
Obviously it is a mammal with four feet. 
In some ways, it looks like a camel which has a long neck, admittedly not as long as the giraffe.
And those spots on the hide of a giraffe&mdash; no camel has spots like that.
In fact it looks very much like the spots on a leopard.
</p>
<p>
Thus the first Greek who named the giraffe called it "camel-leopard."
The Greek word is <a href="../lexicon/kam.html#kamhlopardalis">καμηλοπάρδαλις</a> <br />
<a href="../lexicon/kam.html#kamhlos">κάμηλος</a> = camel<br />
<a href="../lexicon/pard.html#pardalis">πάρδαλις</a> = leopard<br />
</p
<p>
Interestingly, while the camel was ritually unclean for food, the LXX declares that the giraffe was clean, Deut 14:5.
That must have confused Jews who read the LXX since, in reality, giraffes are ritually unclean.
</p>
<p>
Even the English word "leopard" is made from <a href="../lexicon/le.html#lewn">λέων</a> and πάρδος (meaning "panther") and was once thought to be an offspring of a lion and panther.
