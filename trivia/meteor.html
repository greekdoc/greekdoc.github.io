<article class="main"><h3>Meteor vs Meteorite</h3>

<p>
 When Aristotle wrote a book on weather he called it <em>Meteorologica</em>.
 </p>
 <dl>
	<dt><a href="../lexicon/meth.html#methoros" title="lofty">μετήορος</a>  (meteoros)</dt>
		<dd>lofty, high in the air</dd>
	</dt>
	<dt><a href="../lexicon/lo.html#logos" title="statement">λόγος</a>  (logos)</dt>
		<dd>word, an account of, statement, study</dd>
	</dt>
</dl>
<p>
Thus Aristotle's book concerned the study of things which happen high up in the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>

The science of weather and weather forecasting today is called “meteorology.”
</p>
<p>

But Aristotle thought that certain phenomena, such as shooting stars, were events in the atmosphere — which, of course, is correct as far as it goes. A shooting star is an event taking place in the atmosphere. However he was unaware that shooting stars had an astronomical origin.
</p>
<p>

Later, stones that had fallen out of the sky were called meteors or meteorites. The two words
were used interchangeably at first — they are still  used that way in several languages — but later English astronomical usage began to make a sharp distinction.
</p>
<p>

Each term describes a rock which is of celestial origin.

<dl>
	<dt>Meteorite</dt>
	<dd>an object which has landed on the earth and can be picked up from the ground.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>Meteor</dt>
	<dd>an object which flashes through the sky and may or may not land on the earth. Some are burned up upon entry.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>Meteroid</dt>
	<dd>an object which is still in space before it enters the earth’s atmosphere.</dd>
</dl>
