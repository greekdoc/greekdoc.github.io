The widow's meagre donation of 2 leptas would be worth $2.00 which amount was not mere pennies as some translations suggest. It could still be enough to purchase a little bit of food.
</p><p>
Two sparrows sold for $8.00 (Matt 10:29) or five sparrows sold for $16.00 (Luke 12:6).
</p><p>
The servants in Luke 19 were each given ten minas ($76,800), one doubled his money and brought back $153,600; one got half again as much and brought back $115,200; and the last didn't invest the money and brought back only the initial amount.

</p><p>
A woman had ten δραχμή worth an equivalent of $1280, but she lost one worth $128. Of course she swept the floor looking for it (Luke 15:8,9).
</p><p>
The coin that Peter found in the mouth of the fish would be worth $512, and would pay the tax of a double-drachma (δίδραχμον) for both Peter and Jesus (Matt 17:24, 27).
</p><p>
In Matt. 18, one man owed 10,000 talents which would be worth $4,608,000,000. Although he was initially forgiven such a great amount, he didn't know that being forgiven requires granting forgiveness. The other man owed only 100 denarii which would be equivalent to $12,800.
</p><p>
Another man left money on loan to his servants (Matt 25). The first was given five talents ($2,304,000) and he doubled his money. The second was given two talents ($921,600) and also doubled his money. But the man who was given one talent ($460,800) hid his money and should have at least banked his money to receive some interest on it.

</p>
<p>
Apparently the disciples calculated that 200 denarii ($25,600) would not buy enough for feeding 5000 men and their families, which is about $5 per family (Mark 6:37; John 6:7).
</p>
<p>
At the house of Simon the leper, Jesus was anointed with fragrant oil that could have been sold for 300 denarii ($38,400) and given to the poor (Mark 14:5; John 12:5).
</p>

<p>
Jesus asked about the depth of love when one man was forgiven 500 denarii ($64,000) while the other was forgiven 50 denarii ($6,400), (Luke 7:41).
</p>

<p>
The good Samaritan prepaid the hotel bill with two denarii ($256) (Luke 10:35).

</p><p>
According to Rev 6:6, the price of goods will rise so high that a litre of wheat would sell for $128, and three litres of barley would sell for $128.
