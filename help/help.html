			<h2><a id="purpose">The Purpose</a></h2>
			<p class='box'><span class='b'>There are many on-line Greek texts of Koine writings such as the New Testament, the Septuagint, Apocrypha, and Early Church Writings, so why another one?</span></p>
			<ol>					
				<li>This site is intended to teach Greek for the beginner by reading the text.
					<ol>
						<li>It assumes some understanding of the Greek alphabet.</li>
						<li>There are many words which are obvious when you pronounce them.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>If you have taken a few lessons in Greek, you know some vocabulary.
					<ol>
						<li>Thus you can begin to read parts of the verse as you go along.</li>
						<li>When you encounter an unfamiliar word, clicking on it will take you to the lexicon to see its meaning and its parsing (i.e., identification).</li>
						<li>If you hover over the word, its basic meaning will appear.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>There are many other sites and books displaying these scriptural texts
					<ol>
						<li>but when you encounter a new word, you must resort to a book or another website to locate the meaning and even a third book or website to discover the parsing. </li>
						<li>That process slows down the flow of reading the text. </li>
						<li>In contrast I hope this website will facilitate a quicker ease of reading the text and thus make reading the Greek smoother and more enjoyable.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

				<h2><a id="grammar">The Grammar</a></h2>
				<ol>
					<li>When you click on any link-word (usually in blue) in the text, you will be taken to a lexicon where you will see the following:
						<ol>
							<li>The Greek word itself in red</li>
							<li>The parsing (i.e., grammatical breakdown) of that particular word in green.</li>
							<li>Either:
								<ol>
									<li>the definition of the root word.</li>
									<li>or another link to the root word where the meaning is displayed</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>	
					<li>Nouns and participles show the case, gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and number (singular or plural)
					<li>Cases are given as
						<ol>
							<li>Nom = Nominative (usually the subject of the clause or sentence)</li>
							<li>Gen = Genitive/Ablative
								<ol>
									<li>Genitive case is generally the indirect object which describes the character or relation and is usually translated with the English  preposition <i>of</i> as in, <i>this is a bar of steel</i> or <i>this is a poem of Longfellow</i> or <i>the pen of the king</i></li>
									<li>Ablative case generally gives the idea of departure or separation and is usually translated with the prepositions <i>off</i>, <i>from</i>, <i>away from</i></li>
									<li>Since both the Genitive and Ablative forms are identical, students often learn this case as the <i>of/from</i> case.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Dat = Locative/Instrumental/Dative
								<ol>
									<li>Locative case is generally the case of position often translated with the prepositions <i>in</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>among</i>, <i>at</i>, <i>by</i> as in <i>the boy is by the pool</i></li>
									<li>Instrumental case is generally the case of means or association often translated with the prepositions <i>with</i> or <i>by</i> as in <i>travel by car</i>, <i>open with force</i></li>
									<li>Dative case is generally the case of interest or advantage often translated with the prepositions <i>to</i> or <i>for</i> as in <i>give this to Mary</i>, <i>it is for you</i></li>
									<li>Since these three cases are identical in form, students sometimes call them the LID or Dat case. While the Gen case is the <i>of/from</i> case some students call this case, "all the rest" meaning all the rest of the prepositions.
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Acc = Acusative. This is the case of limitation or extension and is often the direct object of a verb idea.</li>
							<li>Voc = Vocative. This is the case of address or exclamation.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Verbs have tense, mode or mood, and voice.
						<ol>
							<li>Tense: In Greek, the tense describes the kind of action as much as the time of action. They include
								<ol>
									<li>Present tense describing on-going action usually in current time</li>
									<li>Imperfect tense describing on-going action usually in past time</li>
									<li>Future tense describing on-going or punctiliary action in future time</li>
									<li>Aorist tense describing punctiliary action at some time</li>
									<li>Perfect tense usually describing punctiliar action with on-going results</li>
									<li>Pluperfect tense is the perfect tense in past time</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Mode or mood can be indicative, subjunctive, optative, or imperative.
								<ol>
									<li>The mode/mood tells whether an action is actually happening or possibly happening.</li>
									<li>Indicative: the action of the verb is actual</li>
									<li>Subjunctive: the action of the verb is objectively possible</li>
									<li>Optative: the action of the verb is subjectively possible</li>
									<li>Imperative: the action is volitionally possible (i.e., a command)</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Voice can be active, middle, or passive
								<ol>
									<li>Active: the subject is producing the action</li>
									<li>Middle: the subject is participating in the action</li>
									<li>Passive: the subject is receiving the action</li>
									<li>Often the middle and passive forms are identical</li>
									<li>Sometimes a verb will have a middle/passive form but be active in meaning. The verb is called deponent.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Participles are adjectives with a verbal idea and a noun form
						<ol>
							<li>Thus they are built from the verb stem so that they have tense and voice (but not mode/mood)</li>
							<li>The tense reveals the kind of action, not its time. The time of action is dependent upon the time of the main verb.</li>	
							<li>They also have noun endings which give them case, number, and gender</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
<!-- 				<h2>Lexicon</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>The lexicon shows the word found in the text, its parsing, and a link to its</li> root.
					<li>The root word will also contain the meaning and any forms derived from the root word.</li>
					<li>Also, the root word may include a list of compound words constructed from the root word. You can hyperlink to them.</li>
					<li>In some instances a concordance to the text itself may be shown.</li>
