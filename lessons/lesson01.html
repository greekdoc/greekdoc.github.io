			<h1>LESSON 1<br>ALPHABET</h1>
			<h2>Ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ<sup>1</sup></h2><br>
		</div>
		<div class='main'>
			<h3>Introducing the Alphabet</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>The Greek Alphabet consists of 24 letters.
					<ol>
						<li>Many of these letters are equivalent to English (actually Latin) letters.</li>
						<li>For example beta is equivalent to our "b."</li>
						<li>Some Greek letters stand for two English letters, for example: phi is equivalent to our "ph" as in "<span class='r'>ph</span>otogra<span class='r'>ph</span>."</li>
						<li>The Greek alphabet is not in the same order as the English one.</li>
						<li>For instance, the third Greek letter is gamma (equivalent to "g") while ours is "c"; also "z" is the last letter of our alphabet, but zeta is the sixth letter.</li>
						<li>Their last letter is omega.</li>
						<li>Thus Jesus said, "I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and end."</li>
						<li>In effect He was saying, "I am the first letter of the alphabet and the last letter of the alphabet."</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Four things are important about learning the alphabet:
					<ol>
						<li>learn the names of the Greek letters</li>
						<li>learn how to say the sound that each letter makes</li>
						<li>learn how to say the sound of the letters when they appear beside another Greek letter</li>
						<li>learn how to write the Greek letters.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>The Greek alphabet</h3>
			<table class='vleft'>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Α α</span></td>
					<td>alpha (AHL-fuh) upper case: <span class='t'>Α</span><br>
						lower case: <span class='t'>α</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "ah" as in "father," not "ay" as in "fate" or "a" as in "fat."<br>
						In some books, lower case alpha looks very much like our 'a'.<br>
						The letter is made in the lower half of the line.<br>
						The lower case letter may have accents above it.<br>
						The upper case letter may have accents to its left side.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Β β</span></td>
					<td>beta (BAY-tuh) upper case: <span class='t'>Β</span><br>
						lower case: <span class='t'>β</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "b" as in "bible."<br>
						Notice in the lower case beta that the long stroke on the left side extends below the
						line and the top loop is in the upper half of the line.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Γ γ</span></td>
					<td>gamma (GAM-muh) upper case: <span class='t'>Γ</span><br>lower case: <span class='t'>γ</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "g" as in "gag."<br>When two gammas appear side by side, the first one sounds like "n" thus
						making an "ng" sound as in the word "sing."<br>Likewise a gamma before a kappa makes
						a "nk" sound as in "ink."<br>
						Notice that the tail of the lower case gamma extends
						below the line.<br>Do not make a "y" shape with two strokes; just start in the upper
						left, go down, then back up to the right in one fluid stroke.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Δ δ</span></td>
					<td>delta (DELL-tuh) upper case: <span class='t'>Δ</span><br>lower case: <span class='t'>δ</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "d" as in "dog."<br>
						Notice that in the lower case delta the stroke on the right side is not straight as it is in our letter "d."<br>
						Instead it is curved. Start with "circle" part in the middle of the letter and end with the "tail" at the top of the letter.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Ε&nbsp;ε&nbsp;&#1108;</span></td>
					<td>epsilon (EPP-suh-lawn) upper case: <span class='t'>Ε</span><br>
						lower case: <span class='t'>ε</span> or <span class='t'>&#1108;</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "eh" as in "bed," not "ee" as in "seem."<br>
						Like lower case alpha, epsilon is only half height.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Ζ ζ</span></td>
					<td>zeta (ZAY-tuh) upper case: <span class='t'>Ζ</span><br>lower case: <span class='t'>ζ</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "dz" as in "adze" or "ds" in "adds."<br>
						Notice that there is only one loop at the top and a curl below the line. Start with the stroke at the top of the letter and end with the loop at the bottom just below the line.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Η η</span></td>
					<td>eta (AY-tuh) upper case: <span class='t'>Η</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>η</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "ay" as the "e" in "obey."<br>
						Notice that the right hand stroke drops below the line.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Θ&nbsp;θ&nbsp;&#977;</span></td>
					<td>theta (THAY-tuh) upper case: <span class='t'>Θ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>θ</span> or &#977;.<br>
						Pronounced "th" as in "think."<br>
						Notice that the lower case letter occupies the full height between the lines.<br>
						Sometimes the lower case letter is made like the second example.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Ι ι</span></td>
					<td>iota (ee-OH-tuh) upper case: <span class='t'>Ι</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>ι</span>.<br>
						It may be pronounced short as in the word "it" or long as the "ee" sound in the
						word "intrigue." It is never pronounced "eye."<br>
						Notice that there is no dot above this letter as we make in English.<br>
						When this letter is at the beginning of word it is often transliterated as "j"
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Κ κ</span></td>
					<td>kappa (KAP-puh) upper case: <span class='t'>Κ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>κ</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "k" as in "kit."<br>
						In some books this letter appears to be a smaller form of the letter "N" (&#1008;)
						and may look unusual to you.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Λ λ</span></td>
					<td>lambda (LAMB-duh) upper case: <span class='t'>Λ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>λ</span> .<br>
						Pronounced "l" as in "light."<br>
						You can make the long stroke before the short one or vice versa.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Μ μ</span></td>
					<td>mu (MOO) upper case: <span class='t'>Μ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>μ</span> .<br>
						Pronounced "m" as in "mother."<br>
						Notice that this letter looks like the letter "u" except it has a long stroke on
						the left side which begins below the line. Start with the stroke below the line. In this way, it will feel like a M.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Ν ν</span></td>
					<td>nu (NOO) upper case: <span class='t'>Ν</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>ν</span> .<br>
						Pronounced "n" as in "not."<br>
						Notice that the lower case letter is made like a "v" in that it has a pointed
						bottom.<br> It also has a short vertical line on the left side.<br> Be sure that the
						letter has both the vertical line and the pointed bottom or else it could be
						confused with the letter upsilon.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Ξ ξ</span></td>
					<td>xi (KSEE) upper case: <span class='t'>Ξ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>ξ</span> .
						Pronounced "ks" or "x" as in "socks" or "fox."<br>
						Notice that the upper case letter is made of three horizontal bars which are not
						connected to each other.<br> The lower case letter looks similar to zeta except
						there is one more loop in the middle of the character. Start at the top and end below the line.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Ο ο</span></td>
					<td>omicron (AH-muh-crawn) upper case: <span class='t'>Ο</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>ο</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "ah" as a short "o" as in "odd."
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Π π</span></td>
					<td>pi (PEE) Upper case: <span class='t'>Π</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>π</span> .<br>
						If you are referring to the mathematical constant (3.141592654 etc.) then you can
						pronounce the name of this letter PIE, otherwise call it PEE.<br> Pronounced "p" as
						in "put."
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Ρ ρ</span></td>
					<td>rho (ROE) Upper case: <span class='t'>Ρ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>ρ</span>.<br>
						Actually the name of this letter is pronounced with initial aspiration: huh-roe.<br>
						Pronounced "r" as in "rat."<br>
						Some teachers suggest forming this letter by starting at the bottom of the stroke
						and ending with the loop.<br> Because this letter looks like a latin "p" but is really
						an "r," there is a good psychological reason for making the letter with the loop
						first and ending with the down stroke.<br> In this way, you won't think "p" but you
						will think "rho."
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Σ σ ς</span></td>
					<td>sigma (SIG-muh) upper case: <span class='t'>Σ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>σ</span> or <span class='t'>ς</span>.<br>
						Use <span class='t'>ς</span> when sigma
						appears at the end of a word (called terminal-sigma).
						Use <span class='t'>σ</span> at the beginning or somewhere in the
						middle of a word (called medial-sigma).
						Examples: <span class='t'>σοφός</span> &mdash; <span class='t'>μισθός</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "s" as in "sit," not the "z-sound." For the medial, start with the loop and end with the tail.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Τ τ</span></td>
					<td>tau (TOW rhymes with NOW) upper case: <span class='t'>Τ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>τ</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "t" as in "test."
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Υ υ</span></td>
					<td>upsilon (OOP-suh-lawn) upper case: <span class='t'>Υ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>υ</span>.<br>
						Pronounced like the German &#252; as in t&#252;, or as the French "u" as in tu.<br>
						English speaking people have difficulty pronouncing this letter.<br> Make your mouth in
						the form of a long "a" (such as in the word "tray").<br> While your mouth is contorted
						in this fashion, say "oo" instead. If you can pronounce this letter differently
						from a normal "oo" sound, you will find that the distinction between words is much
						easier.<br> If, however, you are unable to hear the difference, it probably won't make
						too much difference to you in the pronunciation of Greek words.<br>
						Notice that the lower case letter has a rounded bottom to distinguish it from a
						lower case nu.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Φ φ</span></td>
					<td>phi (FEE) upper case: <span class='t'>Φ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>φ</span>.<br>
						Pronounced like the "f-sound" in "philosophy" or "telephone."
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Χ χ</span></td>
					<td>chi (KEE) upper case: <span class='t'>Χ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>χ</span>.<br>
						Pronounced like the "ch" in "character."<br> Actually the sound is a harsh "k" sound as
						in the Scottish "Loch," or the German "ach."<br>
						Notice that both lines of the lower case letter extend below the writing line.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig'>Ψ ψ</span></td>
					<td>psi (Puh-see) upper case: <span class='t'>Ψ</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>ψ</span>.<br>
						Pronounced "ps" as in "tops." It is not silent as in the English pronunciation of
						"psychology."<br>
						Notice that the "u" part of the lower case letter sits on the line and the vertical
						stroke extends below the line.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='vbig2'>Ω ω</span></td>
					<td>omega (oh-MAY-guh) upper case: <span class='t'>Ω</span>
						<br>lower case: <span class='t'>ω</span>.<br>
						Pronounced as a long "o" as in the word "hope."<br>
						Do not make the lower case form of this letter like the English "w" with its
						pointed bottoms.<br> They should be rounded.

			<ol>
				<li>There are a few more letters which are used only rarely in older Greek writing and never in the New Testament. They are given here for your information, you do not		need to learn them (upper case, followed by lower case):
					<ol>
						<li>stigma <span class='t'>Ϛ, ϛ</span></li>
						<li>digamma <span class='t'>Ϝ, ϝ</span></li>
						<li>koppa <span class='t'>Ϙ, ϙ</span></li>
						<li>sampi <span class='t'>Ϡ, ϡ</span></li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The English word "alphabet" (<span class='t'>ἀλφα-βητα</span>) is obviously borrowed from		the Greek. The Romans adapted it into the forms (with a few exceptions) that we use today.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3><a id='character'>Alphabet characteristics</a></h3>
			<p>Greek characters can be divided into these groups: vowels, breathing marks, consonants, and accents.</p>
			<h4>Vowels</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>There are seven vowels: <span class='t'>α, ε, η, ι, ο, υ, ω</span>.
					<ol>
						<li>The vowels <span class='t'>ε</span> and <span class='t'>ο</span> are always short vowels</li>
						<li>The vowels <span class='t'>η</span> and <span class='t'>ω</span> are always long.</li>
						<li>The vowels <span class='t'>α, ι</span>, and <span class='t'>υ</span> may be long or short.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Sometimes two vowels are joined together to form a different sound from either of the individual vowels.
					<ol>
						<li>We call this combination of vowels a diphthong (<span class='t'>δίφθογγος</span> which means "double sounding").</li>
						<li>A diphthong is considered to be one syllable.</li>
						<li>The second vowel of a diphthong is always either <span class='t'>ι</span> or <span class='t'>υ</span>.</li>
						<li>All diphthongs are considered long except when <span class='t'>αι</span> or <span class='t'>οι</span> are the last two letters of a word.</li>
						<li>Thus <span class='t'>οι</span> is short in <span class='t'>λόγοι</span>; but long in <span class='t'>λόγοις</span> and <span class='t'>οἶκος</span>.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Pronouncing diphthongs
					<ol>
						<li><span class='t'>αι</span> is pronounced "eye" as in "aisle" (e.g., <span class='t'>φαινόμενον</span> [fi-NOM-en-on] "phenomenon").</li>
						<li><span class='t'>ει</span> is pronounced "eye" as in "height" or "ay" as in "pray" (e.g., <span class='t'>ἔκλειψις</span> [EK-lie-psis] "eclipse").</li>
						<li><span class='t'>οι</span> is pronounced "oi" as in "oil" (e.g., <span class='t'>Δελφοί</span> [dell-FOY] "Delphoi").</li>
						<li><span class='t'>υι</span> is pronounced "wee" (e.g., <span class='t'>υἱός</span> [huh-wee-OS] "son").</li>
						<li><span class='t'>αυ</span> is pronounced "ow" as in "cow" (e.g., <span class='t'>αὐτός</span> [ow-TOSS] "this").</li>
						<li><span class='t'>ευ</span> is pronounced "oo" as in "feud" (e.g., <span class='t'>Εὐριπίδης</span> [you-reh-PEE-days] "Euripides").</li>
						<li><span class='t'>ηυ</span> is pronounced "ay-oo" (e.g., <span class='t'>ηὕρηκα</span> [hay-YOU-ray-kuh] "I have found (eurika)").</li>
						<li><span class='t'>ου</span> is pronounced "oo" as in "group" (e.g., <span class='t'>οὐρανός</span> [oo-rah-NOSS] "heaven" from which the planet Uranus gets its name).</li>
						<li>If any diphthong which ends in upsilon is directly followed by another vowel, the upsilon is pronounced as the English "v" <span class='t'>εὐαγγέλιον</span> [ev-an-GELL-ee-on] "gospel (evangelical)."</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Improper diphthongs
					<ol>
						<li>An improper diphthong may be created when one of the following three vowels (<span class='t'>α, η, ω</span>) is combined with iota.</li>
						<li>When iota is joined to these letters, the iota is placed below the lower case letter: <span class='t'>ᾳ ῃ ῳ</span>.
							<ol>
								<li>Notice the iota is placed in the middle of <span class='t'>α</span> and <span class='t'>ω</span>, under the letter</li>
								<li>But for <span class='t'>η</span> it appears below the left stem</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>This iota is called iota subscript: <span class='t'>δόξᾷ, αρχῇ, λόγῳ</span>.</li>
						<li>The iota subscript does not affect the pronunciation.</li>
						<li>For instance, alpha with iota subscript is pronounced "ah" &mdash; just like alpha alone.</li>
						<li>The omega in each of these two words is pronounced exactly the same: <span class='t'>λόγῳ, λέγω</span>.</li>
						<li>When an improper diphthong is put into upper case (capital letters), the iota subscript is turned into a full iota and is placed beside the vowel: <span class='t'>δόξᾷ</span> = <span class='t'>ΔΟΞΑΙ</span>, <span class='t'>αρχῇ</span> = <span class='t'>ΑΡΧΗΙ</span>, <span class='t'>λόγῳ</span> = <span class='t'>ΛΟΓΩΙ</span>.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Breathing marks</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>The Athenians originally used the letter <span class='t'>H</span> for an aspirated sound (h-sound).
					<ol>
						<li>When they adopted the Ionic alphabet, however, the symbol <span class='t'>H</span> was already in use as eta.</li>
						<li>A new symbol was necessary to replace it, so they divided the letter <span class='t'>H</span> into <span class='t'>&#9507;</span> and <span class='t'>&#9515;</span>.</li>
						<li>Later these developed into <span class='t'>&#8216;</span> and <span class='t'>&#8217;</span> respectively.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The symbol <span class='t'>&#8216;</span> indicates a rough breathing equivalent to our "h" sound as in "house."
					<ol>
						<li>It is not to be confused with the "h" that appears in the three Greek letters <span class='t'>θ</span>, <span class='t'>φ</span>, and <span class='t'>χ</span> (th, ph, ch).</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The symbol <span class='t'>&#8217;</span> indicates a smooth breathing which does not change the sound of the word.
					<ol>
						<li>If it does not affect the pronunciation of the word, then why put it in?</li>
						<li>Simply to confirm that the vowel does not have a rough breathing mark.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The breathing mark always precedes a capital letter: <span class='t'>Ἔθνος, Ἦλθον</span>.</li>
				<li>The breathing mark is placed above a lower case letter: <span class='t'>ἔθνος, ἦλθον</span>.</li>
				<li>When a word begins with a diphthong, the breathing mark is placed over the second letter: <span class='t'>εἰκών, οἰκία, εὑρίσκω</span>.</li>
				<li>Any word beginning with rho has the rough breathing mark: <span class='t'>ῥῆμα</span>.</li>
				<li>Similarly, words with a double rho sometimes receive both breathing marks: <span class='t'>Πύῤῥος</span> (Pyrrus) <span class='t'>ἄῤῥητος</span> (unspeakable).
					<ol>
						<li>Although it must be noted that in a lot of texts a double rho doesn't have any breathing marks.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Every initial vowel or diphthong has a breathing mark.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Consonants</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>There are several kinds of consonants: mute, liquid, and sibilant.
					<ol>
						<li>Mute consonants are those letters which do not make a sound unless you add a vowel.
							<ol>
								<li>Try to say "tom" without the "om" ending.</li>
								<li>You are stuck with your tongue positioned at the roof of your mouth waiting for a vowel.</li>
								<li>Okay, say the vowel so you don't pass out.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>There are nine mute consonants categorized according to aspiration and mouth formation.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

			<ol>
				<li value='3'>What is the difference in pronunciation between the two English words "pat" and "bat"?
					<ol>
						<li>Say them aloud.</li>
						<li>Some have suggested that one is softer than the other, but that is not the difference.</li>
						<li>Both are said with the lips, but "bat" is different from "pat" because you voice the initial letter "b."</li>
						<li>In other words, if you were to say these two words in slow motion, you would observe that you begin to hum the "b" before it reaches the lips.</li>
						<li>The same difference is seen between "t" and "d" or between "k" and "g."</li>
						<li>Thus we categorize these pairs into voiceless (or smooth) and voiced mutes.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Aspirated mutes add the letter "h" to the sound.
					<ol>
						<li>Originally phi was pronounced puh-hee.</li>
						<li>Now we just say that they are a little rougher than the voiceless or voiced mutes.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The consonants <span class='t'>π, β</span>, and <span class='t'>φ</span> are called labials because they are made with the lips.</li>
				<li>The consonants <span class='t'>τ, δ</span>, and <span class='t'>θ</span> are called dentals because they are "tooth sounds."
					<ol>
						<li>Admittedly <span class='t'>τ</span> and <span class='t'>δ</span> are made with the tongue just behind the teeth, but some people put the tongue right behind the upper front teeth while others place the tongue on the hard palate behind the teeth.</li>
						<li>Sometimes these letters are called linguals (articulated with the tongue) because of the position of the tongue.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The consonants <span class='t'>κ, γ</span>, and <span class='t'>χ</span> are called palatals or gutterals because they are throat sounds made toward the back of the mouth, close to the throat.
					<ol>
						<li>Here, "palatal" refers to the soft palate of the mouth.</li>
						<li>Gamma is always hard like the "g" in "goat" not like the "g" in "germ."</li>
						<li>Whenever a gamma comes before another gutteral, the first gamma is pronounced like an "n": <span class='t'>γάγγλιον</span> [GANG-lee-on] (ganglion), <span class='t'>ἄγκυρα</span> [ANK-oo-rah] (anchor), <span class='t'>Ἀγχισης</span> [ANCH-iss-ays] (Anchises), <span class='t'>σφίγξ</span> [SFINKS] (sphinx).</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>There are four liquid consonants: <span class='t'>λ, μ, ν, ρ</span>.
					<ol>
						<li>Liquid consonants are different from mute consonants because liquids make a sound when you say the letter.</li>
						<li>For instance, the letter μ makes the "mmm" sound even if there is no following vowel.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>There are four sibilant (hissing) consonants: <span class='t'>σ</span> (or <span class='t'>ς</span> at the end of a word), <span class='t'>ξ</span>, <span class='t'>ψ</span>, and <span class='t'>ζ</span>.
					<ol>
						<li>The last three letters are really double consonants:
							<ol>
								<li>a labial plus sigma produces <span class='t'>ψ</span> (<span class='t'>πσ, βσ, φσ</span>)</li>
								<li>a dental plus sigma produces <span class='t'>ζ</span> (<span class='t'>τσ, δσ, θσ</span>)</li>
								<li>a gutteral plus sigma produces <span class='t'>ξ</span> (<span class='t'>κσ, γσ, χσ</span>)</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Sigma is usually pronounced like "s" in "sit."</li>
						<li>Before the liquid consonants (<span class='t'>λ, μ, ν, ρ</span>), or voiced (middle) mutes (<span class='t'>β, δ, γ</span>), it is pronounced like our "z": <span class='t'>Σμύρνα</span> (ZMERR-nuh) Smyrna.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The only consonants that can end Greek words are <span class='t'>ν, ρ, ς</span>.
					<ol>
						<li><span class='t'>ξ, ψ, ζ</span> should be included because they are double consonants ending in sigma.</li>
						<li>There are only three exceptions: <span class='t'>ἐκ, οὐκ, οὐχ</span></li>
						<li>Proper names can end in any letter.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

			<h3><a id='accent'>Accents</a></h3>
			<ol>
				<li>In Greek, there are three accents that may appear above vowels:
					<ol>
						<li>grave: <span class='t'>&grave;</span> (a short slanting line from upper left to lower right)</li>
						<li>acute: <span class='t'>&acute;</span> (a short slanting line from upper right to lower left)</li>
						<li>cirmumflex: <span class='t'>~</span> or <span class='t'>&circ;</span> (a publisher may choose to use either one)</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>At this point in studying Greek, it is not necessary to learn the rules for the placement of the Greek accent.</li>
				<li>Some teachers do not even mention accents when they teach Greek.</li>
				<li>In most instances accents are not necessary.</li>
				<li>In English, we do not mark the accented syllables and we get along without too much trouble.</li>
				<li>In modern Greek, accents are rarely used.</li>
				<li>There are some words which need the accent marked or else confusion results, but they will be discussed later. For instance
					<ol>
						<li><span class='t'>κάλος</span> means "rope," however <span class='t'>καλός</span> means "beautiful."</li>
						<li><span class='t'>μένω</span> means "I remain," however <span class='t'>μενῶ</span> means "I shall remain."</li>
						<li><span class='t'>βασιλεία</span> means "kingdom," but <span class='t'>βασίλεια</span> means "queen."</li>
						<li>Can you think of some English words which are verbs if you accent it one way and nouns if you accent it another way?</li>
						<li>How about: preSENT and PRESent?</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Accent rules
					<ol>
						<li>Most words have only one accent.</li>
						<li>Some have no accent.</li>
						<li>Depending on the type used in a book, the circumflex will look like <span class='t'>~</span> or <span class='t'>&circ;</span>. You can use whichever one you like, just be consistent.</li>
						<li>If a word in the vocabulary has an acute on its last syllable, it may change to grave when there is a following word and no punctuation.</li>
						<li>Sometimes a word will capture the accent of the following word so that it now has two accents while the next word has no accent.</li>
						<li>There are rules to explain these phenomena, but they will be explained later.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>A diaeresis <span class='t'>¨</span> is written over an iota or upsilon to show that the vowel is not to be considered part of a diphthong:
					<ol>
						<li><span class='t'>καρύϊνος</span> (4 syllables: kah-ROO-ee-noss) almond.</li>
						<li><span class='t'>Μωϋσῆς</span> (3 syllables: moh-oo-SAYS) Moses.</li>
						<li><span class='t'>ἀΐδιος</span> (4 syllables: ah-EE-deh-oss) eternal. Notice that the accent fits between the two dots.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3><a id="punctuation">Punctuation</a></h3>
			<ol>
				<li>The period indicates the end of a sentence.</li>
				<li>You will notice in the New Testament, that sentences do not always begin with an uppercase letter. Instead, Greeks considered that the paragraph, not the sentence, deserved an initial uppercase.</li>
				<li>The comma is like the English comma.</li>
				<li>Greek has a <span class='t'>&#183;</span> that looks like a raised period and functions like our semi-colon and colon.</li>
				<li>The question mark is a character that looks like our semi-colon "<span class='t'>;</span>" &mdash; I bet the first time you encounter a sentence which ends with a <span class='t'>;</span> you will forget it is a question.</li>
