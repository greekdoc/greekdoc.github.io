			<h3><a id='verbs'>VERBS</a></h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Verbs are words which indicate an action or a state (e.g., jump, develop, climb, is, seems).</li>
				<li>When we looked at nouns we said the various forms of a particular noun are "declined" into case, gender, and number.</li>
				<li>Now we look at verbs which are "conjugated" or "parsed" into five characteristics: tense, mode, voice, person, and number.
			</ol>
				<h4>Tense</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>The tense of a verb in English indicates the time of action (present, past, future).
						<li>Greek verbs indicate two things:
							<ol>
								<li>time of action
									<ol>
										<li>present</li>
										<li>past</li>
										<li>future</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>kind of action
									<ol>
										<li>spot action</li>
										<li>continuous action</li>
										<li>spot action with continuing results</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>The most important feature of Greek verbs is the kind of action, not its time.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Continuous action is shown in the Greek present tense and imperfect tense.
							<ol>
								<li>You might think of these tenses as a video-camera view of the action. It is on-going.</li>
								<li>While the word <span class='t'>γράφω</span> may mean <span class='i'>I write</span>, it may also be translated: <span class='i'>I am writing, I keep on writing</span>. In some instances, it may be translated: <span class='i'>I do write</span>.</li>
								<li>The basic idea of the present tense is that of continuous or continual action.</li>
								<li>Thus "<span class='i'>He is coughing all night</span>" may mean that it was one steady, eight-hour cough (continuous), or it may mean the sessions of coughing were interspersed by periods of silence (continual).</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Both English and Greek have another use for the present called the Historic Present or Historical Present.
							<ol>
								<li>The verb is in the present, but it describes a past event with the vividness of a present occurrence.</li>
								<li>Here's an example: "<span class='i'>Yesterday I bumped into Tom. I owe him some money. There I am running down the street. Tom is chasing me. I jump into my car and drive away</span>."
									<ol>
										<li>All of these events happened in the past (yesterday), but <span class='i'>am running</span>, <span class='i'>is chasing</span>, <span class='i'>jump</span>, and <span class='i'>drive</span> are all in the present to show a sense of urgency, immediacy, or excitement.</li>
										<li>If they were all in the past, it loses that sense: "<span class='i'>Yesterday I bumped into Tom. I owe him some money. I ran down the street. Tom chased me. I jumped into my car and drove away</span>."
										</li>										
									</ol>
								</li>
								
								<li>When you come across a sentence in the present tense, don't assume that it must be in current time.
									<ol>
										<li>Examples:
											<p class='box'><span class='b'>καὶ ὀψίας γενομένης ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν δώδεκα.</span><br><span class='n'>and when it was evening, He <span class='r'>comes</span> with the twelve</span> (Mark 14:17)</p>
											<p class='box'><span class='b'>Ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις παραγίνεται Ἰωάννης ὁ βαπτιστὴς κηρύσσων</span><br><span class='n'>in those days, John the Baptist <span class='r'>comes</span> preaching</span> (Matt 3:1)</p>
											<p class='box'><span class='b'>Τῇ ἐπαύριον βλέπει τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἐρχόμενον</span><br><span class='n'>on the next day he <span class='r'>sees</span> Jesus coming</span> (John 1:29)</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											For example, when Paul uses the present tense in Rom. 7:8-25, he is using the historical present. A saved Christian cannot say, "O wretched man that I am!" (v24). Paul is describing the struggle that he had as a faithful Pharisee who was convicted by the 10th command. The solution for his struggle with the law was in Jesus Christ who justified him (8:1). No condemnation is justification.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Spot action is shown in the aorist tense.
							<ol>
								<li>You might think of this tense as a snapshot. "He hit me."</li>
								<li>In some instances, this tense may be used to describe something as a spot action, which may have taken quite a long	time to do.</li>
								<li>For instance, "He built a house." It may have taken eight months to build the house, but that whole period of time is seen as one event.</li>
								<li>Further details on this tense will be indicated in future lessons.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Another kind of action is found in the perfect tense. This tense indicates spot action with on-going results. "I have built a house with the on-going			result that the house is still standing."</li>
					</ol>
				<h4>Mode</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>When we talk about mode (some grammars call it mood), we usually indicate	whether a particular verb action is actually happening or might happen.
						<li>The indicative mode gives factual information from the perspective of the writer or speaker:
							<ol>
								<li>"I ran to town."</li>
								<li>"I am breathing."</li>
								<li>"I will kiss you tonight."</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Other modes indicate the possibility of happening:
							<ol>
								<li>"Run to town!"</li>
								<li>"I would be running if I knew the direction."</li>
								<li>"I might be able to finish my assignment."</li>
								<li>"I wish I could kiss you."</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
				<h4>Voice</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>When we talk about voice, we are indicating the relationship between the subject and the verb.
							<ol>
								<li>Is the subject doing the action?</li>
								<li>Is the subject receiving the action?	</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><span class='r'>Active voice</span>: We use the active voice if the subject is doing the action: "The dog bit the postman."</li>
						<li><span class='r'>Passive voice</span>: We use the passive voice if the subject receives the action: "The dog was bitten by the postman."</li>
						<li><span class='r'>Note</span>: in each of these two sentences, "the dog" is the subject.
							<ol>
								<li>In the first sentence the subject (the dog) is doing the biting</li>
								<li>But in the second sentence, the subject (the dog) is <span class='b'>receiving</span> the biting.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Unlike English, Greek has another voice which we will study later.</li>
						<li>Some students confuse passive voice with past tense.
							<ol>
								<li>The expression <span class='i b'>past tense</span> indicates action which happened in the past.</li>
								<li>The passive voice means that the subject is receiving the action of the verb.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Examples:
							<ol>
								<li><span class='i b'>Bill found a ball in his yard.</span> The subject is <span class='r'>Bill</span> and he is doing the action&mdash;thus the voice of the verb is <span class='r'>Active</span>.</li>
								<li><span class='i b'>Bill was found by the police.</span> The subject is <span class='r'>Bill</span> and the police are doing the action&mdash;thus the voice of the verb is <span class='r'>Passive</span>.</li>
								<li><span class='i b'>When the police found Bill, he was returned to his mother.</span>
									<ol>
										<li>There are two clauses (thus two verbs) here.</li>
										<li>In the first clause, the subject "<span class='r'>police</span>" is doing the action&mdash;thus the voice of the first verb is <span class='r'>Active</span>.</li>
										<li>In the second clause, the subject "<span class='r'>he</span>" (referring back to Bill) is receiving the action&mdash;thus the voice of the second verb is <span class='r'>Passive</span>.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li><span class='i b'>Bill lost his ball glove.</span> The subject is doing the action&mdash;thus the verb is <span class='r'>Active</span>.</li>
								<li><span class='i b'>Dad bought Bill a new glove.</span> Again the verb is <span class='r'>Active</span>.</li>
								<li><span class='i b'>Bill's old glove was found in the dog house.</span> The subject <span class='b'>glove</span> is not doing the action&mdash;thus the verb is <span class='r'>Passive</span>.</li>
								<li><span class='i b'>The glove was retrieved by Dad.</span> <span class='r'>Passive</span>.</li>
								<li><span class='i b'>The old glove will never be used again.</span> <span class='r'>Passive</span>.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Person</h4>
						<ol>
						<li>In English, we must add a pronoun or noun to a verb in order to clarify who is	doing the action.
						<li>The verb "are running" may mean "we are running," "you are running," or "they are running."</li>
						<li>In Greek, the designation of who is the subject is indicated by attaching a personal ending (suffix) to the end of the stem of a verb.</li>
						<li>For example, <span class='t'>γραφ-</span> is the stem of the verb for the action of writing.</li>
						<li>By adding the appropriate personal endings, we discover who is writing.
							<ol>
								<li>Thus <span class='t'>γράφω</span> means <span class='i b'>I write</span>.</li>
								<li>The stem (or root) of the word is <span class='t'>γραφ-</span>.</li>
								<li>When we add the personal ending <span class='t'>-ω</span>, we discover that the subject, "<span class='r'>I</span>", is doing the writing.</li>
								<li>You will never find the stem by itself in any sentence&mdash;it will always have a personal ending.</li>
								<li>For instance, <span class='t'>γράφει</span> means <span class='i b'>he writes</span>.
									<ol>
										<li>Thus, the personal ending <span class='t'>-ει</span> indicates that the subject is the personal pronoun <span class='b r'>he</span>, <span class='b r'>she</span>, or <span class='b r'>it</span>.</li>
										<li>You will learn the endings a little later in this lesson.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>Sometimes, the subject is already identified: <span class='t'>ἄνθρωπος γράφει</span> means <span class='i b'>a man writes</span>.
									<ol>
										<li>Don't translate it <span class='i b'>a man he writes</span>.</li>
										<li>The word "<span class='b r'>he</span>" is not necessary this time, because you have already identified who the personal ending refers to (<span class='r'>a man</span>) and you don't need the pronoun.</li>
										<li>Remember that a pronoun is a substitute for a noun.</li>
										<li>If we know the noun, we don't need the substitute.</li>
										<li>But we will still need the personal ending <span class='t'>-ει</span>.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
			<h4>Number</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Number indicates singular or plural.</li>
				<li>In Classical Greek, there is a form for dual referring to a pair of people or things; but it does not appear in the New Testament.</li>
			</ol>

<div class='clear'></div><br>
<ol>
	<li>Notice that each Greek verb is made up of three elements:
		<ol>
			<li>the stem (<span class='t'>γραφ-</span>)</li>
			<li>the thematic vowel <span class='t'>ο/ε</span> (sometimes called the connecting vowel)</li>
			<li>the ending</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Examples of the thematic vowel:<br><span class='t'>γράφ+ε+ις,<br> γράφ+ε+ι,<br> γράφ+ο+μεν,<br> γράφ+ε+τε,<br> γράφ+ο+υσι</span>
		<ol>
			<li>In some instances, the thematic vowel is hidden in the ending: <span class='t'>γράφω</span></li>
			<li>The stem (or root) is always the same: <span class='t'>γράφ-</span></li>
			<li>The thematic vowel is either <span class='t'>ο</span> or <span class='t'>ε</span>.</li>
			<li>It follows this rule:
				<ol>
					<li><span class='t'>ο</span> always comes before the letters <span class='t'>μ</span> or <span class='t'>ν</span></li>
					<li>while <span class='t'>ε</span> comes before the others.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>This rule will make more sense later.</li>
			<li>You will note that there are apparent exceptions to this rule in the first and last words: <span class='t'>γράφω</span> and <span class='t'>γράφουσι</span>.</li>
			<li>This discrepancy came about because the original pattern was:
				<table class='vleft'>
					<tr><td class='t'><span class='t'>γράφομι</span></td><td><span class='t'>γράφομεν</span></td><td rowspan='3'>here the rule works</td></tr>
					<tr><td class='t'><span class='t'>γράφεσι</span></td><td><span class='t'>γράφετε</span></td></tr>
					<tr><td class='t'><span class='t'>γράφετι</span></td><td><span class='t'>γράφοντσι</span></td></tr>
				</table>
				<div class='clear'></div><br>
			</li>
			<li>In the process of time, some of these words experienced contraction.
				<ol>
					<li>Similarly, in English, "do not" became "don't."</li>
					<li>In Greek, 
						<ul>
							<li><span class='t'>-ομι</span> became <span class='t'>-ω</span></li>
							<li><span class='t'>-εσι</span> became <span class='t'>-εις</span></li>
							<li><span class='t'>-ετι</span> became <span class='t'>-ει</span></li>
							<li><span class='t'>-οντσι</span> became <span class='t'>-ουσι</span>.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Some of the rules of contraction will be explored in later lessons.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>You don't have to learn the original pattern. Instead, concentrate on the contracted pattern.</li>
			<li>Learn the endings <span class='t'>-ω, -εις, -ει, -ομεν, -ετε, -ουσι</span>. </li>
			<li>They sound like "Oh, ice, eye, ah-men, et-uh, oo-see"</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>The endings indicate both person and number.
		<ol>
			<li>The first person is the one closest at hand: e.g., <span class='r'>I</span> or <span class='r'>we</span>.</li>
			<li>The second person is the next nearest one: e.g., <span class='r'>you</span>. In Old English, the word <span class='b'>thou</span> was used for the second person singular and <span class='b'>ye</span> for plural.</li>
			<li>The third person is the furthest one away: e.g., <span class='r'>he, she, it, they</span>.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Number indicates singular or plural.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Parsing</h4>
<ol>
	<li>To parse a verb means to indicate its characteristics of tense, mode, voice, person, and number.
	<li>Thus <span class='t'>γράφεις</span> is parsed by saying it is present, indicative, active, second person, singular.</li>
	<li>The stem of each one of these verbs is found by removing the final <span class='t'>ω</span> from the Greek vocabulary word.</li>
	<li>Add the appropriate personal endings to form the meaning you want.</li>
	<li>You should memorize the endings<br><span class='t'>-ω, -εις, -ει, -ομεν, -ετε, -ουσι</span>.</li>
	<li>When a sentence has no subject indicated, use the pronoun found within the personal ending of the verb.
		<ol>
			<li>Thus <span class='t'>βλέπει ἄνθρωπον</span> means <span class='i r b'>he sees a man</span>.</li>
			<li>You will notice that the word <span class='t'>ἄνθρωπον</span> is in the ACC case, so it cannot be the subject of the sentence.</li>
			<li>Thus you must not translate it: <span class='i b r'>A man sees</span>.</li>
			<li>If the subject (a word in the NOM case) is identified, you do not need to repeat the pronoun.</li>
			<li>Thus <span class='t'>ἀπόστολος βλέπει ἄνθρωπον</span> means <span class='i b r'>An apostle sees a man</span>.</li>
			<li>Do not translate it <span class='i b r'>An apostle he sees a man</span>.</li>
			<li>The word <span class='i b r'>he</span> is not necessary because you already know the subject.</li>
			<li>Pronouns are substitutes for missing subjects.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>TRANSLATION HELP</h3>
<ol>
	<li>In order to translate effectively, here is some help</li>
	<li>Learn all the words given in the vocabulary.</li>
	<li>Learn all the forms as they are presented in each lesson.</li>
	<li>Note the significance of the various nouns in the translation sentences&mdash;are they singular	or plural? What case are they?</li>
	<li>Note the tense, mode, voice, person, and number of each verb.</li>
	<li>Read the Greek sentence aloud.</li>
	<li>Note familiar and cognate words. Cognate words are words that are similar in both Greek and English.</li>
	<li>Group words together by their endings (i.e., keep a group of words in the GEN case together).</li>
	<li>Do not jump around in the sentence, follow the logical order.</li>
	<li>The most emphatic word is at the beginning of a sentence or clause; the next most important is at the end of that sentence or clause.</li>
	<li>Consult a dictionary or lexicon as a last resort.</li>
	<li>Put your English translation above each Greek word. If you are not sure of a particular word, leave it and do the others. Then come back and try the ones you left blank.</li>
	<li>Locate the noun in the NOM case&mdash;that is probably your subject. If there is no NOM noun, maybe the verb contains the pronoun idea.</li>
	<li>For other nouns, check the case.
		<ol>
			<li>If it is in the GEN case, put either <span class='r'>of/from</span> in front of	your English word.</li>
			<li>Later you can consider which of your options (e.g., <span class='b'>of a	river</span> or <span class='b'>from a river</span>) works best.</li>
			<li>If it is in the DAT case, write <span class=''>in/by/to</span> in front of your English word (most often it will be to).
			<li>If the noun is in the ACC case, it will probably be the	direct object.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If it is still unclear, copy out the parts of the sentence which are clear.
		<ol>
			<li>Then leave the	sentence to work on another one. </li>
			<li>When you are done, come back to the sentences which	were incomplete. </li>
			<li>Reread the sentence in Greek until it becomes clear.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Translate into clear and accurate English.</li>
	<li>If the exercise has an English word in brackets, it means that the Greek word to the left	was not included in the vocabulary, so its meaning is given to you.</li>
</ol>
		<h3>Translation examples</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><span class='t'>ἄνθρωπος γράφει</span>.
				<ol>
					<li><span class='i b'>A man writes</span>.</li>
					<li>Not: <span class='i b'>The man writes</span>.</li>
					<li>If there is no article "the" in the Greek sentence, then translate it "a" in the singular.</li>
					<li>Note also, it is not <span class='i b'>A man he writes</span>.</li>
					<li>If you know the subject, drop the "he."</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><span class='t'>ἄνθρωποι γράφουσι ἀποστόλῳ</span>.
				<ol>
					<li><span class='i b'>Men write to an apostle</span>.</li>
					<li>"Men" is the subject, not "apostle," because "men" is in the NOM case.</li>
					<li><span class='t'>γράφουσι</span> is the third person plural "they write" -- that's another clue.</li>
					<li>"Apostle" is in the DAT case, note the iota-subscript.</li>
					<li>Technically this word could be translated "for an apostle," "at an apostle," "with an apostle," "in an apostle."</li>
					<li>The context will make the sense clear.</li>
					<li>Probably "to" or "for" makes the most sense.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><span class='t'>δοῦλος ἀνθρώπου λέγει λόγον</span>.
				<ol>
					<li><span class='i b'>A slave of a man speaks a word</span>.</li>
					<li>"Slave" must be the subject because it is the only noun in the NOM case.</li>
					<li>"Man" is in the GEN case and thus the need for "of," "from," or even "off of."</li>
					<li>Probably "of" is best.</li>
					<li>Be sure not to put a "the" in front of "man."</li>
					<li>"Speaks" is in the third person singular form.</li>
					<li>"Word" is in the ACC case.</li>
					<li>It receives the action.</li>
					<li>It is the direct object.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><span class='t'>ἀνθρώπου δούλος λόγον λέγει</span>.
				<ol>
					<li><span class='i b'>A slave of a man speaks a word</span>.</li>
					<li>This is translated just like the previous sentence.</li>
					<li>The emphasis is different, but the literal translation is exactly the same no matter what the word order is like.</li>
					<li>So, to translate a sentence like this, find the NOM case and verb.</li>
					<li>Admittedly man is at the front of the sentence, but only slave is in the NOM case.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>In the translation exercise below, the little words (<span class='t'>ὁ, οἱ, τοῦ, τοῦς, τὸν, τῷ, τῶν, τοῖς</span>) all mean <span class="i r">the</span>. We will study them in the next lesson.
		</ol>
	<h3>Translate the following:</h3>
		<ol class='d'>
		<li>ὁ ἀδελφὸς τοῦ ἀγγέλου βλέπει τοῦς ἀποστόλους.</li>
		<li>γινώσκετε τὸν γάμον τοῦ δούλου.</li>
