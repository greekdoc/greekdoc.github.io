			<h3><a id='sub'>Subjunctive Mode</a></h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Up to this point, we have been looking only at the indicative mode which confirms the reality of the action from the viewpoint of the speaker.</li>
				<li>The subjunctive mode4 indicates potential action.
					<ol>
						<li>In English, when we say, I was a richman (that would be indicative)</li>
						<li>but to show it is not actual, we say, If I were a richman.... (and thus use the subjunctive form <span class='i b'>were</span> instead of <span class='i b'>was</span>)</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>In the New Testament, there are some rare uses of the subjunctive in the Perfect tense, but the subjunctive is primarily seen in the present and aorist tenses.</li>
				<li>The forms of the subjunctive are regular following the form of the present subjunctive of <span class='t'>εἰμί</span>.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3><a id='fun'>The function of the mode</a></h3>
			<ol>
				<li>The indicative mode tells us that the action of the verb is real while other modes (subjunctive, optative, and imperative) tell us that the action of the verb is potential.</li>
				<li>Examples of the kinds of mode
					<ol>
						<li>Indicative mode:
							<ol>
								<li>The child runs.</li>
								<li>This expresses action which is really taking place.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Subjunctive mode:
							<ol>
								<li>If the child runs, he will escape.</li>
								<li>This expresses action which is not really taking place, but which is objectively possible.</li>
								<li>The child has the ability to run.</li>
								<li>Of all the potential modes, the subjunctive is nearest to reality.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Optative mode:
							<ol>
								<li>Oh, that the child would run!</li>
								<li>This expresses action which is not really taking place, but which is subjectively possible.</li>
								<li>It is one step further removed from the action of the subjunctive mode.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Imperative mode:
							<ol>
								<li>Run, child.</li>
								<li>This expresses action which is not really taking place, but which is volitionally possible.</li>
								<li>The action will happen if there is an exertion of the will to produce the action.</li>
								<li>It is the furthest removed from the action of the indicative mode.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3><a id='time'>Time and Action of Modes</a></h3>
			<ol>
				<li>All the modes reveal the kind of action
					<ol>
						<li><span class='t'>ἐὰν λύω</span> means <span class='i b'>if I continue loosing</span> or <span class='i b'>if I keep on loosing</span>.</li>
						<li><span class='t'>ἐὰν λύσω</span> means <span class='i b'>if I loose in one act</span>.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Only the indicative mode gives us the time of action.</li>
				<li>The time of the action of the subjunctive mode is relative to the time of the main verb.</li>
				<li>In the following three sentences, the clause <span class='t'>ἵνα εἴπω αὐτῷ</span> is the same. Only the main verb is different.
					<ol>
						<li><span class='t'>ἔρχομαι ἵνα εἴπω αὐτῷ.</span> I am coming that I may speak to him.</li>
						<li><span class='t'>ἦλθον ἵνα εἴπω αὐτῷ.</span> I came that I might speak to him.</li>
						<li><span class='t'>ἐλεύσομαι ἵνα εἴπω αὐτῷ.</span> I shall come that I may speak to him</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>In all these sentences, the aorist subjunctive εἴπω indicates a single act of speaking.
					<ol>
						<li>In the first sentence, the act of speaking is in the present time</li>
						<li>In the second, the act of speaking is in the past time</li>
						<li>In the third, the act of speaking is in the future time.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>So, the subjunctive does not have its own time, it borrows the time from the main verb.</li>
				<li>If the subjunctive verb in each of these examples were in the present tense instead of the aorist, then the sentences would express on-going conversation in the present, past, or future time depending on the time of the main verb.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3><a id='type'>Types of the subjuctive mode</a></h3>
			<ol>
				<li>The hortatory subjunctive
					<ol>
						<li>Uses the first person plural to exhort others to join us in an action</li>
						<li><span class='t'>ἔλθωμεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον.</span> <span class='i b'>Let us go into the house.</span></li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The prohibitive subjunctive
					<ol>
						<li>Uses the second person aorist subjunctive (never the present subjunctive)</li>
						<li>It expresses a negative command forbidding the beginning of an act and may be translated: don't start, or don't ever. </li>
						<li><span class='t'>εἰς πειρασμὸν μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς</span>. <span class='i b'>Lead us not into temptation</span> or <span class='i b'>Don't start to lead us into temptation</span> or <span class='i b'>Don't ever lead us into temptation.</span></li>
						<li>When we look at the imperative mode in the next lesson, we have a prohibition which urges us to stop doing an action.</li>
						<li>In John 20:17, we read, <span class='t'>λέγει αὐτῇ ̓Ιησοῦς· μή μου ἅπτου, οὔπω γὰρ ἀναβέβηκα πρὸς τὸν πατέρα·</span> <span class='i b'>Jesus said to her, don't touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father.</span>
							<ol>
								<li>If the verb <span class='t'>ἅπτου</span> is subjunctive, then the sentence would read, <span class='i b'>Don't start to touch me.</span></li>
								<li>But it is not in the subjunctive.</li>
								<li>Some have built a theology whereby the Lord had a special body that shouldn't be touched until He had first presented Himself to the Father.</li>
								<li>That view is based on a poor understanding of the verb in this sentence.</li>
								<li>The verb is in the imperative meaning, <span class='i b'>Stop touching me.</span></li>
								<li>In other words, Mary was clinging or clutching the Lord as though she did not want to lose Him again.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The deliberative subjunctive
					<ol>
						<li>It is used to express a question which is rhetorical and does not expect an answer</li>
						<li>It is also a question which expects an answer in the imperative.</li>
						<li><span class='t'>τί εἴπω ὑμῖν;</span> <span class='i b'>What shall I say to you?</span></li>
						<li>If an answer is expected at all, it will be in the imperative: <span class='i b'>say this!</span></li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Emphatic negation subjunctive
					<ol>
						<li>In this construction there is a double negative <span class='t'>οὐ μή</span> plus the subjunctive which gives a stronger emphasis than just <span class='t'>οὐ</span> plus the indicative.</li>
						<li><span class='t'>οὐ μὴ εκφύγωσιν.</span> <span class='i b'>They shall NOT escape.</span> or <span class='i b'>They shall NEVER escape.</span> or <span class='i b'>They shall by no means escape.</span></li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The subjunctive of purpose or result
					<ol>
						<li>This is a construction where the subordinate clause begins with <span class='t'>ἵνα</span> generally to express purpose and is translated, <span class='i b'>in order that.</span></li>
						<li><span class='t'>ἔρχομαι ἵνα εἴπω αὐτῷ.</span> <span class='i b'>I am come in order that I may speak to him.</span></li>
						<li>Some grammars will speak of the telic or ecbatic use of a <span class='t'>ἵνα</span> clause.
							<ol>
								<li>Telic: denotes intention or purpose, thus <span class='t'>ἵνα πληρώθη</span> <span class='i b'>in order that it might be fulfilled</span></li>
								<li>Ecbatic: denotes result or consequence, thus <span class='t'>ἵνα πληρώθη</span> <span class='i b'>so that it was fulfilled</span></li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The subjunctive of condition
					<ol>
						<li>In this example, the subjunctive is used with the conjunction <span class='t'>ἐάν</span>.</li>
						<li>It is called the third class conditional use which will be described below.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3><a id='con'>Conditional sentences</a></h3>
			<ol>
				<li>A conditional sentence is one where the subordinate clause presents an "if" statement followed by the main action of the verb.</li>
				<li>Think of it as an "if-sentence" with two parts.
					<ol>
						<li>The protasis: the if clause</li>
						<li>The apodosis: the fulfilment or main clause</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>There are four classes of conditional sentences</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>First class condition</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>It affirms the reality of the condition.</li>
				<li>Construction:
					<ol>
						<li>Conjunction: <span class='t'>εἰ</span></li>
						<li>Protasis: a verb in the indicative mode (and any tense)</li>
						<li>Apodosis: almost any mode or tense.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class='t'>εἰ μαθηταί ἐσμεν τοῦ κυρίου σωθησόμεθα.</span><br><span class='i b'>If we are disciples of the Lord, we shall be saved.</span>		<br>This construction confirms the condition and can also be translated,<br><span class='i b'>Since we are disciples of the Lord, we shall be saved.</span></li>
				<li><span class='t'>εἰ ἐμὲ ζητεῖτε, ἄφετε τούτους ὑπάγειν.</span><br><span class='i b'>If (or, since) you seek me, allow these to depart.</span> (John 18:8)</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Second class condition</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Expresses a condition which is contrary to fact.</li>
				<li>In English, a contrary to fact condition is expressed with the subjunctive mode.
					<ol>
						<li><span class='i b'>If I <span class='t'>were</span> a rich man, I'd live like a king.</span></li>
						<li>In English, "were" is the subjunctive form.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Compare the following
					<table>
						<tr><th>Contrary to fact</th><th class='w'>NOT contrary to fact</th></tr>
						<tr><td>If I were you, I would not go</td><td class='l'>If he was sick, he did not show it</td></tr>
						<tr><td>If you were older, you would understand</td><td class='l'>If he was there, I did not see him.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>If this were Sunday, I would be in church</td><td class='l'>If the pen was new, why did it not write?</td></tr>
						<tr><td>If he had left yesterday, he would be here today</td><td class='l'>If he was mayor, I can understand his action.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>I wish my father were here</td><td class='l'>&nbsp;</td></tr>
					</table>
<div class='clear'></div><br>
				</li>
				<li>However in Greek, a contrary-to-fact condition is different in construction and does not use the subjunctive.</li>
				<li>Construction:
					<ol>
						<li>Conjunction: <span class='t'>εἰ</span></li>
						<li>Protasis: verb in indicative mode and past tense</li>
						<li>Apodosis: the little word <span class='t'>ἄν</span> plus the indicative mode and past tense verb</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Contrary to fact in present time uses the imperfect tense in both the protasis and apodosis.
					<ol>
						<li><span class='t'>οὗτος εἰ ἦν ὁ προφήτης, ἐγίνωσκεν ἄν τίς καὶ ποταπὴ ἡ γυνή.</span><br><span class='i b'>If this man were a prophet, he would know who and what sort of woman this is.</span> (Luke 7:39)</li>
						<li><span class='t'>εἰ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου ἦτε, ὁ κόσμος ἄν τὸ ἴδιον ἐφίλει.</span><br><span class='i b'>If you were of the world, the world would love its own.</span> (John 15:19)</li>
						<li><span class='t'>εἰ μὴ ἦλθον καὶ ἐλάλησα αὐτοῖς, ἁμαρτίαν οὐκ εἴχοσαν.</span><br><span class='i b'>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin.</span> (John 15:22)</li>
						<li><span class='t'>εἰ ἔτι ἀνθρώποις ἤρεσκον, Χριστοῦ δοῦλος οὐκ ἄν ἤμην.</span><br><span class='i b'>If I still pleased men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</span> (Gal. 1:10)</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Contrary to fact in past time uses the aorist or pluperfect tense in both the protasis and apodosis
					<ol>
						<li><span class='t'>εἰ ἦς ὧδε, οὐκ ἄν ἀπέθανεν ὀ ἀδελφός μου</span><br><span class='i b'>If you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> (John 11:32)</li>
						<li><span class='t'>εἰ ἐγνώκειτέ με, καὶ τὸν πατέρα μου ἐγνώκειτε ἄν.</span><br><span class='i b'>If you had known me, you would also have known my father.</span> (John 14:7 TR)</li>
						<li><span class='t'>εἰ ἐν Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι ἐγένοντο αἱ δυνάμεις αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν, πάλαι ἄν ἐν σάκκῳ καὶ σποδῷ μετενόησαν.</span><br><span class='i b'>If the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> (Matt. 11:21)</li>
						<li><span class='t'>εἰ μὴ ἐκολόβωσεν κύριος τὰς ἡμέρας, οὐκ ἄν ἐσώθη πᾶσα σάρξ.</span><br><span class='i b'>If the Lord had not shortened those days, no flesh would be saved.</span> (Mark 13:20)</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Third class condition</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>This is the probable future condition.</li>
				<li>Construction:
					<ol>
						<li>Conjunction: <span class='t'>ἐάν</span></li>
						<li>Protasis: subjunctive mode</li>
						<li>Apodosis: any form needed</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>It tells us that something is not really taking place now, but will probably take place in the future.</li>
				<li><span class='t'>καὶ τοῦτο ποιήσομεν, ἐάνπερ ἐπιτρέπῃ ὁ θεός.</span>.<br><span class='i b'>And this we will do if God permit.</span> (Heb. 6:3)</li>
				<li>Thus, we are not doing it now, but it is probable that we will do it upon the condition of God's permission.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Fourth class condition</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>It expresses possible future condition</li>
				<li>Construction:
					<ol>
						<li>Conjunction: <span class='t'>εἰ</span></li>
						<li>Protasis: optative mode</li>
						<li>Apodosis: <span class='t'>ἄν</span> plus optative mode</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>There are no examples of this condition in its full form in the New Testament.</li>
				<li><span class='t'>ἀλλ᾿ εἰ καὶ πάσχοιτε διὰ δικαιοσύνην, μακάριοι ἄν εἴητε</span>.<br><span class='i b'>But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you would be happy.</span> (I Peter 3:14)</li>
				<li>You are not now suffering, and it may be possible, but it is improbable that you will.</li>
				<li>It is not a reality now and it has little prospect of becoming a reality.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Summary of the conditions</h3>
