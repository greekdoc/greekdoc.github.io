			<ol>
				<li>The Apostle Paul says that God sent forth His Son at the "fullness of time" (Gal. 5:4).
					<ol>
						<li>There were many factors which contributed to making this time ideal.</li>
						<li>There were Roman roads which allowed for quicker transportation.</li>
						<li>There were many merchant ships which moved both goods and people around the Mediterranean Sea.</li>
						<li>There was a common ruling body.</li>
						<li>But, most importantly, there was a common language: Greek.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>You might think that almost any language would be suitable for communicating the Gospel, but such was not the case.
					<ol>
						<li>It is true that Aramaic was spoken by Jesus and His disciples, but it was too local.</li>
						<li>A religion that was destined by God to reach the world needed to be communicated in a world-wide language.</li>
						<li>Classical Greek would not be suitable because it was the language of the upper-class in wealth, culture, and refinement.</li>
						<li>Christianity had a message of hope to the uneducated, the poor, and the oppressed.</li>
						<li>Classical Greek could never reach the general populace.</li>
						<li>At the same time, the upper-class could still understand the common Greek.</li>
						<li>Latin, at this time, was spoken by only a few in what is now Italy.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The Greek language was ideal because of its inflection, exact vocabulary, precision of tenses, and its clarity.
					<ol>
						<li>Take the Hebrew language, for instance, as a contrast with Greek.</li>
						<li>When you read Psalm 119, you quickly suppose that the psalmist must have written this psalm with a Hebrew thesaurus on his lap.</li>
						<li>Look at all the different words he uses to refer to Scripture.</li>
						<li>There really does not seem to be much distinction between these words.</li>
						<li>They are used interchangeably.</li>
						<li>Even in English we use one word which may have two different meanings.</li>
						<li>Do you remember the child's joke: "Who has more power than Superman?" The answer: "A policeman, he can stop a whole line of cars with one hand."</li>
						<li>The Greeks, however, distinguished power as strength from power as authority by using two different words.</li>
						<li>They were never used interchangeably.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Prior to the writing of the New Testament, Greece was not a unified country.
					<ol>
						<li>There were many autonomous city-states separated by rugged terrain.</li>
						<li>In order to maintain their individuality, they fought with each other.</li>
						<li>Each area had its own dialect and orthography (way of forming the letters).</li>
						<li>The prominant dialect, Attic, became the language of culture and philosophy.</li>
						<li>But there were other dialects just as popular: the Aeolic, the Boeotian, the Doric, and the Ionic.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Two factors brought the κοινη [koy-NAY] Greek language into prominence.
					<ol>
						<li>First, Philip of Macedon unified the Greek states around 350 B.C.</li>
						<li>As a result these states were no longer isolated and distinctives of dialect began to disappear.</li>
						<li>Second, Alexander the Great began a rapid conquering of the world.</li>
						<li>Greek culture circled the Mediterranean world and stretched into Asia Minor and even into Persia.</li>
						<li>When Alexander assembled an army from various parts of Greece and Macedonia, the recruits had many differences in dialect and orthography; but these were merged into a popularized language and became the common language spoken by all.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>This common language not only influenced the Greek army and Greek colonies, but it also affected the Jews of the Diaspora who were to translate the Old Testament into Greek.
					<ol>
						<li>We refer to this translation as the Septuagint (LXX).</li>
						<li>The corresponding influence of the Septuagint upon the New Testament is significant.</li>
						<li>The κοινη language was popular from about 300 B.C. to 330 A.D.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
